# SECBank CBS

SECBank CBS is an early-stage core banking system blueprint aligned with BSP (Bangko Sentral ng Pilipinas) regulatory expectations and patterned after the modular, product-centric approach found in platforms like RBSoftech. This repository currently captures the system vision, domain boundaries, compliance checkpoints, and a staged delivery plan.

## Objectives

- Establish a BSP-aligned core banking foundation for deposits, lending, treasury, and channels.
- Model the platform with clear domain modules, strong auditability, and risk controls.
- Provide a baseline architecture and data model references for future implementation.

## Repository Structure

- `docs/overview.md` - system vision, scope, and guiding principles.
- `docs/modules.md` - core modules and responsibilities.
- `docs/architecture.md` - target architecture, integrations, and non-functional goals.
- `docs/bsp-compliance.md` - compliance checkpoints and operational controls.
- `docs/roadmap.md` - phased implementation plan.

## Next Steps

1. Confirm the prioritized product scope (e.g., CASA, time deposits, loan products).
2. Define BSP reporting and regulatory data requirements in more detail.
3. Translate the architecture into an executable reference implementation.
