# System Overview

## Vision

Deliver a modular, auditable core banking platform for Philippine financial institutions that aligns with BSP standards while enabling product agility similar to RBSoftech-style product suites. The platform should emphasize strong controls, clear separation of duties, and end-to-end traceability across customer onboarding, product lifecycle management, and financial operations.

## Guiding Principles

- **Regulatory alignment first**: design modules to surface BSP compliance evidence by default.
- **Product-centric domain model**: model products as configurable, parameter-driven contracts.
- **Security and auditability**: immutable event trails, segregation of duties, and fine-grained access control.
- **Resilience**: redundant services, controlled failover, and strong data integrity guarantees.
- **Operational transparency**: real-time observability, reconciliation, and exception management.

- Customer & KYC onboarding
- Deposit products (CASA, time deposits)
- Loan products (term loans, working capital)
